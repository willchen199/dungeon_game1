# Overview

This is a text-based console game in C++. It's a simple dungeon crawler game where the player explores a dungeon, encounters monsters, and collects items.
I creat this game to practicing the principal of the C++ syntax.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
